                  First, verify your realmlist is correct (set realmlist login.cmangos-server.com). 
                  Check that you're using client version 1.12.1. Disable your firewall temporarily 
                  to see if it's blocking the connection. If issues persist, visit our{' '}

                <div className="faq-answer">
                  Try these steps: 1) Delete your WDB folder (in your WoW directory), 2) Disable all addons, 
                  3) Run the game in windowed mode, 4) Update your graphics drivers, 5) Run as administrator.

                <div className="faq-answer">
                  Lag can be caused by your internet connection, background applications, or distance 
                  from the server. Try: closing bandwidth-heavy programs, using a wired connection instead 
                  of WiFi, and checking your network during off-peak hours. Run a traceroute to diagnose 
                  connection issues.

                  respect other players, English in global channels. Full rules are available on 
                  our forums. Rule violations result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent bans

                  Multiboxing is allowed as long as you're not using automation software. Each action 
                  must be manually performed. Most vanilla-era addons are permitted, but any addon 
                  that automates gameplay or provides unfair advantages is forbidden.
